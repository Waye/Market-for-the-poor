Basic features of our website
=============================

Our website will allow the seller of essential goods such as food, drink and clothings to sell their cancelled or refunded orders at a cheaper cost to non-profit organizations. Seller users will be able to post what they want to sell and see the request from the buyers. Buyer users will be able to make purchase on products that they are interested in and make requests to sellers. An chat system is also implemented in our website for communication.
